# Solar System visualisation☀️🪐
Solar system visualization project in C++. The project is a window with 3D visualization of the solar system using geometric shapes. 
The project was written during my university studies to demonstrate the capabilities of the C++ programming language in the field of visualization
###
## Main dependency📚
The basis of the project is the Glut library and its properties. The code is reduced to one file due to the need to demonstrate it in the report.
###
### Possible upgrades🔝
It is advisable to divide the project into various files using OOP principles. 
It is also desirable to revise the basic matrix for calibrating the trajectory of planets.
